# Reflection on the Pirate Intelligent Agent Project
In this project, I developed an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game, where the pirate uses deep Q-learning to locate the treasure optimally. I was provided with starter code that included two main classes: **TreasureMaze.py**, which defined the environment as an 8x8 maze, and **GameExperience.py**, which stored episodes of state transitions for the agent’s learning process. Alongside this, I received a Jupyter Notebook file with the project instructions and some initial setup. My primary task was to complete the skeleton implementation of the deep Q-learning agent by filling in the sections marked with TODOs. This involved creating the learning algorithm, adjusting hyperparameters, and running experiments to ensure the pirate learned effective strategies for reaching the treasure.

Throughout this course, I connected reinforcement learning concepts to the broader field of computer science. At its core, computer science is about problem-solving and building solutions that are both efficient and effective. The pirate agent project highlighted how computer scientists design algorithms that allow systems to adapt and improve through experience, a principle that underpins artificial intelligence. It demonstrated how reinforcement learning, when applied correctly, enables computers to solve dynamic problems in ways that extend beyond games into fields such as robotics, autonomous navigation, and decision-making systems.

My approach to solving problems as a computer scientist begins with breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable components. For this project, I first needed to understand the environment and rules defined in **TreasureMaze**, then examine how experiences were recorded in **GameExperience**, and finally build upon that foundation to implement the Q-learning loop. Testing and debugging were critical steps, as I adjusted exploration rates, reward values, and network configurations to enhance the pirate’s learning abilities. This systematic, iterative process mirrors how I would tackle real-world challenges in software development and machine learning.

Additionally, this project reinforced the ethical responsibilities associated with designing intelligent systems. As a computer scientist, I have a duty to ensure that my solutions respect the needs and rights of end users while aligning with organizational goals. For AI systems in particular, transparency, fairness, and accountability must be prioritized to prevent misuse and unintended harm. Even though this project simulated a pirate in a maze, the lessons extend to larger applications where reinforcement learning could impact real people, such as in autonomous vehicles or healthcare. In those contexts, my responsibility would be to design systems that are safe, reliable, and ethical.
